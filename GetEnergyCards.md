## <div id="GetEnergyCards">How to get Energy cards?</div>

1. You can draw NFT energy cards in the game. Firstly, you need to get LP tokens(CFS-BNB-LP) by stake LP with a value of 0.05bnb in the pancake, then you can draw energy cards once by stake LP in the CryptoForSpeed. LP tokens can be Unstake after 60 days.


2. Use CFS to buy others' energy cards in the Market. But the buyer can only get the NFT energy cards and will not get the LP token that used to get it before at the same time.
