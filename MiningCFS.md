## <div id="MiningCFS">Racing for CFS mining</div>

It's important to remember that the auto card need to bind to the energy card which has not expired for mining, if you put it together, then put the auto card into the garage to start the "racing"(mining process). A maximum of 20 cars can be placed in the garage. When the auto card has been sold or the energy life is over, its position can be released in the garage. Otherwise you can't pick up or buy a new car.


Each auto card can get 4 "Racing" every day (24 hours in Europe timezone). After each race, it takes 60 minutes to recover from freezed so you can start "racing" again. Players are free to decide when to start the "racing". The price during the "racing" determines the number of CFS players can mine. The calculation formula is:

Quantity of CFS in a single "Racing" = (0.5bnb * 5% * 25% * The car's HashPower) / CFS real-time price

For example, if the CFS price is 0.01bnb at some point, you tap the "Racing" button for your Tesla at same point, the Tesla's HashPower is 2, then you can get from once single "Racing":

(0.5BNB*5%*25%*2) /0.01 =1.25 CFS 

Note: the number of "Racing" times can not used in or accumulated to the next day.
