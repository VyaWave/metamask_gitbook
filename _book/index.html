<p>CryptoForSpeed is an NFT-Based Card Game, which brings together eight Auto models such as Tesla and BMW, so that players can enjoy the joy of collecting NFT Auto cards while earning rewards. In a word, Players can obtain CFS token rewards through various play patterns In the game. It should be emphasized that the NFT cards in the CryptoForSpeed are obtained by staking LP. After 60 days, players can release and unstake the LP, which means that the NFT cards are free to some extent! We will launch various peripheral products based on the CryptoForSpeed platform. The players who own NFT cards will get surprises more than expected in the future.</p>
<h2 id="nft-based-auto-cards"><div id="BasedAutoCards">NFT-Based Auto cards</div></h2>
<p>There are 8 brands of CryptoForSpeed. Each brand has a auto model in the early stages. More auto models will be added to the game after the synthetic system has been released. Each auto model called Auto card has a different speed and HashPower,  which represents the ability of it to mining CFS tokens.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Participate in pre-sale. Players will qualify for participating in pre-sale by completing the whitelist task and earn enough entries. You can draw 1 auto card by investing 0.5BNB in Pre-sale&#xFF08;these will be covered later&#xFF09;. Each user who get the pre-sale qualification can draw up to 4 auto cards&#xFF08;2 BNB&#xFF09;. Each time a player draws a NFT auto card, he will get the LP token (0.25BNB and 7500CFS) CFS-BNB-LP with the initial value of 0.5bnb. The LP token can be Unstake after 60 days, noted the auto card will not disappear; A total of 2000 NFT auto cards are distributed totally through pre-sale.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can draw car cards in the game as well. Firstly, you need to get LP tokens(CFS-BNB-LP) by stake LP with a value of 0.5bnb in the pancake, then you can draw auto cards once by stake LP in the CryptoForSpeed; Noted: The LP token can be Unstake after 60 days, and the auto card will not disappear. (You can tap the Unstake after 60days then get your LP released.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use CFS to buy others&apos; auto cards in the Market. In the Market transaction, but the buyer can only get the NFT auto cards and will not get the LP token that used to get it before at the same time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="nft-based-energy-cards"><div id="EnergyCards">NFT-Based Energy cards</div></h2>
<p>In the CryptoForSpeed, the auto card needs an additional energy card to participate in the CFS mining. The combination of that is necessary binding frameworks for mining. So, The NFT energy cards determine the period that the card can go mining CFS benefits. There are 5 kinds of NFT energy cards, with a Energy Life&#xFF08;similar to battery life &#xFF09; ranging from 60 days to 180 days.</p>
<p>After attaching the energy card, your auto obtains the endurance attribute and starts the countdown. When the energy life expires, the card will not be able to use in the racing(mining process). However, the card will not disappear, can still be used for trading and collection, and can be used in future game play patterns.</p>

<li>You can draw NFT energy cards in the game. Firstly, you need to get LP tokens(CFS-BNB-LP) by stake LP with a value of 0.05bnb in the pancake, then you can draw energy cards once by stake LP in the CryptoForSpeed. LP tokens can be Unstake after 60 days.</li>

<h2 id="racing-for-cfs-mining"><div id="MiningCFS">Racing for CFS mining</div></h2>
<p>It&apos;s important to remember that the auto card need to bind to the energy card which has not expired for mining, if you put it together, then put the auto card into the garage to start the &quot;racing&quot;(mining process). A maximum of 20 cars can be placed in the garage. When the auto card has been sold or the energy life is over, its position can be released in the garage. Otherwise you can&apos;t pick up or buy a new car.</p>
<p>Each auto card can get 4 &quot;Racing&quot; every day (24 hours in Europe timezone). After each race, it takes 60 minutes to recover from freezed so you can start &quot;racing&quot; again. Players are free to decide when to start the &quot;racing&quot;. The price during the &quot;racing&quot; determines the number of CFS players can mine. The calculation formula is:</p>
<p>Quantity of CFS in a single &quot;Racing&quot; = (0.5bnb <em> 5% </em> 25% * The car&apos;s HashPower) / CFS real-time price</p>
<p>For example, if the CFS price is 0.01bnb at some point, you tap the &quot;Racing&quot; button for your Tesla at same point, the Tesla&apos;s HashPower is 2, then you can get from once single &quot;Racing&quot;:</p>
<p>(0.5BNB<em>5%</em>25%*2) /0.01 =1.25 CFS </p>
<p>Note: the number of &quot;Racing&quot; times can not used in or accumulated to the next day.</p>
